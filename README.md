# tidal-cloner

Node CLI to clone TIDAL accounts

Available commands: `check`, `clone` and `clear`.

Be careful, `clear` will clear the contents of the *clone* account entirely, **including user generated playlists**.

To use, run the following in a console

```
yarn
yarn run tidalclone [command]
```
